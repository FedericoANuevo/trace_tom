; 1) Declare the DIR where the structure is located, and the filename.

; 2) Load structure into memory and extract all available arrays from it.

; 5) Some explanations follow.
print,'In this case there are N_fl=4 lines that were traced between rmin=1 Rs and rmax=10 Rs. Those are synthetic radial fieldlines with a uniform radial step of 0.0015 Rs. For each field line our structure expects from Judit a maximum of Npt_max=15e3 points. This number will be optimized with Judit, for now it is just an exceedinly large number.'
print
print,'All variables namd NAME_A are 2D arrays of dimensions N_fl x Npt_max. For example: rad_A(ifl,*) contains the radial points of fieldline ifl (=0,..,3 in this example).   Similarly, Ne_aia_A(ifl,*) contains the AIA-based DEMT result for Ne at points rad_A(ifl,*). Etc.'

print
print,'There is a KEY array, provided for each instrument, that deserves a separate explanation: index_sampling_INSTRUMENT_A, with INSTRUMENT being in this case: aia, mk4 or c2. For a given field line ifl, index_sampling_INSTRUMENT_A(ifl,*) contains values 0 and 1: the 1 values indicate a single point within a given tomographic cell grid that samples that cell: it is the mean point within the cell, and its alue is 1 ONLY if there is a result for that INSTRUMENT in that cell, it is 0 if that cell is off the reconstructed volume for that instrument, or if the cell has not been reconstructed, being either a ZDA -for both VL-tomography and DEMT- or a location where the LDEM does not predict accurately all FBEs - for DEMT only-.'

print,'In this way, if one wants to plot the AIA results along field line ifl=0, one does this:'
print,'      ifl = 0'
print,'      tmp = reform(index_sampling_aia_A(idl,*)'
print,' ind_samp = where(tmp eq 1)'
print,' plot,rad_A(ifl,ind_samp),Ne_aia_A(ifl,ind_samp)'

print,'      ifl = 0'
print,'      tmp = reform(index_sampling_c2_A(idl,*)'
print,' ind_samp = where(tmp eq 1)'
print,' plot,rad_A(ifl,ind_samp),Ne_c2_A(ifl,ind_samp)'

print,'This concludes this mini-tutorial, to show the core part of our approach. If you liked the format, I can pass you the plotting routine that, based on this idea explained above, manages to easifly and flexibly combine any provided instruments on a single graph, compute average trends, etc. Let us first know what you think of the approach and data format.'
